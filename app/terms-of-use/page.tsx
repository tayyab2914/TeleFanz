              notify all users of any material changes to these Terms, such as through a notice on our Platform,
              however, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes. We will also update the "Last

              access or use of the Services after the date of the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms
              even if you were not notified. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop accessing or using the
